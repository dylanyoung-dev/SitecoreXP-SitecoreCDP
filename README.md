# SitecoreXP-SitecoreCDP
Creating a Simple module for XP to migrate data from XP into Sitecore CDP.  This demonstrates a way you might be able to migrate your data (Contact + Interactions) into CDP.  Your business rules may be different and therefore you should only use this repo as general guidance.

This module is meant to be "easy" to install in an XP instance and then runs batch processes to Sitecore CDP.  However if you are dealing with massive amounts of data, there might be better and more dedicated methods to do so.
